This Java web application is the construction of a dashboard with data on training given to our clients at ExpertSender. I myself give those trainings, I decided to save information in a database, and this software fetch that information to produce charts that showcase the companies most trained, number of trainings along the recent years per month, course statuses, who has been trained, when, what the course was, etc. all related to the technical trainings I've been giving.

JSP/Servlets, JDBC, MySql, SQL, and ChartJS are the technologies used.

As still a novice, someone who's started Java for the web not much before, this web application is my most advanced software produced till now (28-Jan-2024). I'm proud of the work I put in here, experimenting with JDBC along more than 2 thousand lines of code. This has been possible because I had finally managed to create my first database with modeling it from scratch firstly, and this was a huge achievement to me. To make things even greater, for the first time, I managed to use a JavaScript graphical library and I connected backend data obtained from JDBC to the frontend in order to feed data to produce charts.

Modeling the data, creating the tables, working with queries to join tables, making use of JDBC to extract data with Java, creating the frontend, sharing the extracted data with ChartJS for charts production, I feel so good when I see that I could do it alone.

This software was intended to help searching for companies and people that have already received training, when, what and who, to keep track of everything so that my boss can be aware of the high energy I've been investing on client training for the company. Nevertheless, As nobody has been using this application, I stopped bringing more data to its database.
